# Thesis - Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
The implementation of the prototype.

## Current DIDs
issuer sol: did:sol:devnet:7e3bAN1vRNL7c73awhtwJpXmun5YwhCQffieGoi8vdsb
issuer eth: did:ethr:sepolia:0x9Cf4710D6D53f8E6B579e9EF766eE8E39E03E96F

wallet: did:sol:devnet:E13rUS8is8BU2J7KYnnti4rrmZ6hFCKW6JF9F33QCKhT

## Run
See relevant package.json files in the associated directories

## Deployment
The Issuer and Verifier back-ends has to be deployed or available on a local network. If you want to run the entire thing, you may have to host the back-ends yourself and update the relevant URL/address in the code.

When the thesis is accepted, we will be turning the deployed servers off ourselves. Until then, simply running as is should work.
