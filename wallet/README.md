# Wallet
To start, use:

```console
npm i
npx expo start --tunnel
```

But first you have to create a `.env.api` file and place it in the wallet directory, containing:

```console
ANKR_API_KEY=.....
```

to get a ANKR api key, [visit](https://www.ankr.com/advanced-api/).

The wallet makes heavy use of [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
